### Introduction :recycle:
Did you know that the fashion industry is responsible for **10% of annual global carbon emissions**? Fast fashion is a leading contributor to the rapid production of pollution and is on track to increase their greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50% by 2030. The fashion industry utilizes unethical practices such as the use of cheap, toxic textile dyes to maximize profit at the cost of the environment. Coming in close second after agriculture, the fashion industry is the **second largest global polluter of clean water.**
